# Project Ganache

Design your own wedding cake.

## Overview
Project Ganache is a drag and drop interface for kicking off the design of a wedding cake.

Typically, when deciding on a wedding cake design, a bride will book a consultation with a wedding cake designer who will guide her through the design process. Although the bride has an idea of how many people will attend the wedding she may not know how many cake tiers will be enough for her guests. She may also have a theme in mind and want to communicate some sense of color to the wedding cake designer.
